## Family Background

A family of four, mother and father are both 65 years old, with two children aged 30 and 34 years old. The family describes its financial assets as follows:

1. $2.5 million taxable pocket, currently invested in a $1.5 million municipal bond ladder, with the balance in a diversified investment grade bond fund.
2. $4 million tax-deferred pocket, IRAs, currently invested in a 60/40 mix of equity and bond funds.

The couple currently needs about $200,000 annually to meet their ongoing expenses. They own their home debt-free and have a secondary condominium also debt-free. They accept the assumption that inflation should average 2% per year for the full forecast horizon.

## Goals

They state their goals as follows:

1. Use the $1.5 million municipal bond ladder to provide for their lifestyle expenses for the next 5 years, which they describe as an absolute need (taxable).
2. Assuming that they can afford it, transfer $1 million of their taxable assets other than the municipal bond ladder to their two children, in equal shares, as soon as possible.
3. They need to maintain their current lifestyle for years 6 to 10 (tax-exempt).
4. They want to maintain their current lifestyle until they reach 90 (tax-exempt).
5. At the time they reach 90:
   - If they are still alive, they wish to keep meeting their lifestyle expenses until the last of the two of them dies.
   - Then or when the second to die does die, they wish for their assets to be divided equally between their children and a directed charitable fund, to be steered by their children.
